Yesterday I posted this for sale and my phone blew-up. With a range of offers above and below asking price. I pulled the ad down after 30 minutes because I needed to gather all the information here.
I am close to downtown SLC. I would like to move the bike out of here asap.
Here is all the information you might need.
We don't have the keys to the bike.
It was used intermittently for a few years and the owner's job relocated him to Sweden. It has sat in the garage for a couple of years.
The bike started without a problem (when we had the keys). It was started a few times each year for maintenance.
New key, ignition, and gas caps run about $50 on eBay. Or a locksmith can make a new set for about $200. Missing left side mirror.
Miles: 2100
Accidents: None
Clean Title
Kelly Blue Book: $3600
